    same as math, the operator in JS also have order, like multiply and division first, then adding and minus

    we can through form of order to search the order of operator

    -in form the position most top will have high order, high order execute first, order will also like math start from left to right
        but we don't need memorize the order
        Because () have highest order, so when using operator, we can using () to change ordering
