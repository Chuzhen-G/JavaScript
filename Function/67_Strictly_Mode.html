    There are two kind running code mode in JS:
      -Normal Mode

          in normal mode. The Grammar check are not strictly
          the principle for it: reduce error prompt
        -This handling method will lead the poor runnning performance for the code

      -Strictly Mode
        -In strictly mode, the grammar check will become strictly
          1.Baned grammar
          2.Easier prompt error
          3.Improve performance
      -In real development, trying to using the strictly mode
        Because it can find the hidden problem earlier
          it can also improve the performance of code
