    Change object
      -When change object, if there have other variable that point to this object
        then all variables that point to this object will been affect
      
    Change varaible
      -When change variable, it will only affect current varaible
    When using varaible to store object, it will always make the code become complex because it is easy to change the object point by varaible
      So generally, when declare a variable that store object, we will use const
    Note:
      const will only stop the varible get resign values, but it will not have any affect to the change of object
      which means (the address of varible can't be change, the object it reference to can be modify)
