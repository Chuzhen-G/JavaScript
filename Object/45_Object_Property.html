    Property name
      -Generally property name is a string, so property name can be any value, no special requirement
        But if your property name is too special, then it can't directly use, it need set by []
        But recommend the property name are also follow by identifier naming rule.


      -Also can using symbol as property name
        when get those kind propoerty, we must using symbol
        The property adding by symbol, usually are the property that don't want to be access by outside
      -when using [] to doing operation to property, we can using variable
      obj['property name'] === obj.property name
      obj[Symbol()] and obj[String()]
      if obj contain string variable, then it does not need other string

      property value 
        -can be any kind of value
        -also can be a object
      using typeof to check an object, it will return object
