    do-while loop
      -Grammar:
        do{
          statement....
        }while(conditional expression)
      -Excute order:
        when do-while statement is execute, it will first execute the loop body after do
        after execute, then it will make judgement to the conditional expression after while
        if result is false, then loop will end
        if result is true, then continue loop
      The difference to while:
        while statement is make judgement then execute
        do-while statement is execute then make judgement

        Eg.
          do-while statement can ensure loop at least execute once
