    for loop
      -for loop and while loop does not have intrinsic difference, both of them are using to execute code repeatedly
      -Difference is their grammar structure, for loop is more clearly
      -Grammar:
        for(Initialize expression; conditional expression; update expression){
          statement...
        }
      -Execute process:
        1. execute initialize expression, initialize variable
        2. execute conditional expression, make judgement to whether loop is execute(true execute, false end)
        3. If result is true, then execute loop body
        4. execute update exprerssion to modify the initilize variable
        5. repeat step 2-4, until result to false.
      -Initialize expresssion will only execute once in whole loop
      -Three expression in the for loop can be omit
      -The varaible declare by let in the for() is local variable, outside can not access it
        but the variable declare by var in the for() can be access by outside
      -The method to create infinity loop:
        while(1){}
        for(;;){}
