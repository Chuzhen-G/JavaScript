        if statement after execute will first to make a judgement to the conditional expression
          if the result is true, then it will execute the statement after if,
          if the result is false, then not execute
          if statement will only control the code that in the next line of if, if we want to control multiple line of code, we can using {}
          for the clearity, even if the code after if only have one line, we should also execute code block
        if the conditional expression after "if" is not boolean, then it will convert boolean then doing operation
