    Life span of closure:
      1.closure produce when call outer function, each time when call outer function, it will produce a new closure
      2.It will disapper when the inner function is lose(inner function is lose when Garbage Collection)
    Note:
      Closure is mainly using to hide some contents that don't want to be access by outside
        it means closure need occupy certain memory
      Compare to class, closure will waste memory capacity(class can using prototype but closure can't)
        When the number of execute time is less, using closure
        when the number of execute time require lots, using class
