  /* 
    Object-orient characteristic:
      Encapsulation
      Inheritance
      Polymorphism
    1.Encapsulation
      -Object is a container that using to store different kind property
      -Object is not only responsive to store property, it also need to responsive for the safety of data
      -The property we directly adding to the object are not safety, because they can be change arbitray
      -How to ensure the safety of data:
        1.specialize data
          -to specialize the data we want to protect, and only can using inside at the class
        2.provide setter and getter method to open access for the property
          -Specialize property, and it can be benefit when using getter and setter method
          -1.can control the rights of read and write to the property
          -2.can doing the verification to the data
      -Encapsulation is mainly using to ensure the safety for the data
      -The method to archive encapsulation
        1.specialized property adding #
        2.using getter and setter method to control property
          get property_name(){
            return this.#property
          }
          set property_name(parameter){
            this.#property_name=parameter
          }

  class Person{
    #address = 'huoguoshang'//entity property using # at the beginning will change it to the specialize property,specialize property can only access by class inside
    //specialize property need to declare at first before it assign value
