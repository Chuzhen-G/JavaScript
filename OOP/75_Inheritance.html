  /* 
    Inheritance
      -we can using extends keyword to archive inherits
      -when a class inherits another class, it is same as copy the code from another class to current class(easy understand)
      -when inherit occur, the class that been inherit are called (super class) parent class, the inherit class called child class
      -Through using inheritance we can reduce the repeatedly code, and doing the extends without change a class

      Encapsulation -- Safety
      Polymorphism -- Flexibility
      Inheritance -- Extends
