    The prototype object of same type object are same 
      it is same as saying same type object have same prototype

    Role of prototype:
      prototype is same as a public area that can be access by all the entities that in this class
        It can store the public property(method) of an object in a class uniformly to the prototype
        so we only need to create one property, then it can be access by all the entities at this class
    
    The inheritance in JS is archive by prototype(parent class entity is the prototype of child class)

    Some property value in object is specialized,  like property(name, age, gender), every object should have their own value
      But some value are same to every object, like method, (prototype allow we don't need to repeatedly to create those same value)
