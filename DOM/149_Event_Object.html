    In DOM there exist many different type event object
      -All the event object have a common ancestor, Event
      -The bubble of event
            -event.target  The object who trigger the event
            -event.currentTarget  The object who bind with the event(similar to this)
            -event.stopPropagation()  stop event propagation
            -event.preventDefault()  cancel the default behavior


        -The bubble of event means the up transform for the event
        -This means if an event is occur in one elements, then the same events in its ancestors will also occur
        (In this case, click box2 will also occur the event at the box1, and it is the trigger)
        (But also, if we don't put the event at the box2, the event at the box1 will also occur,
        which means even if we don't have event at box2, when we click box2, it will occur the event at the box1)
        -The exist of bubble simplify the writing of code, but in some scenario we don't want bubble exist
          -When don't want event bubble, we can using event object to cancel bubble
