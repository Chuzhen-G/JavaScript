    /* 
      Event loop 
        -Every time when function is in execute, it will producec a execute environment
        -Execute environment will be responsive to store the data produce when execute function
        -Question:Where does the execute environment of function store at?
          -execute environment of function is store in the call stack
        -stack, is a data structure, characteristic last in, first out
        -queue, is a data structure, characteristic first in, first out
        Call stack
          -call stack is responsive to store the execute environment of fucntion
          -when a function is been call, its execute environment will be as a stack frame
            -To insert in the top of the call stack, after the function is call complete it will automatically eject from the top of stack
        Message queue
          -Message queue reponse to store the function that will be execute
          -when we trigger a event, its responsive function is not directly adding to the call stack
            Because call stack may exist some code that have not execute completel yet
          -After event trigger, JS engine will insert event responsive function to the message queue to wait
      The message queue showing the event may will delay because other event is in execute, so other event need to wait it complete.
      Message queue also illustrate event will store in a queue, and can be execute if the stack is empty
