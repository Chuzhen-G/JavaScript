      Event propagation function
        -In DOM, the propagation of event can separate to threee stage
          1.Catch stage (From ancestor element to the target element to doing the catch of event)(default situation: event will not occur in the catch stage)
          2.Target stage {Object of trigger}
          3.Buble stage (From target element to the ancestor element to doing the propagation of event)
        -Catch of event, it meaans the propagation of event from out to inside
          when our current element is trigger event, then it will start the biggest ancestor element of current element to doing the catch of event to the current element 
        -If we want to trigger event at the catch stage, we can set true in the third parameter of addEventListener
          generally we don't want event is trigger at the catch stage, so in general we don't need set third parameter
