<!-- normal(without async or defer), if put at the middle, the html will wait the script load fully, then script implement to elements, then run rest of html files. -->
<!-- async(can using to execute the script async), which means javascript and the html loading at the same time, whenever javascript is ready, it will implement its
 script, even if the html doesn't really yet, so the order is uncertain
 Note:can only using for the external javascript -->

 then start to execute this script, order is certain as html first then script -->
