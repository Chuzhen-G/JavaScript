  /* 
    In JS, all the content that can be doing the custom naming are consider to be the identifier,
      such as variable name, function name, class name .....
      when using the identifier, we have to follow those naming rule:
        1.identifier can only be contain letters, numbers, underline, dollar sign and can't using number to begin.
        2.identifier can not be the keyword and reserve word in JS. Also not recommand using the build-in function and class as the variable name
        3.naming standards:
          -using CamelCase:
            -the first letter lowercase, each word beginning uppercase
            -maxlength -> maxLength
            -borderleftwidth -> borderLeftWidth
          -class name will using big CamelCase:
            -maxlength -> MaxLength
          -The letter for constance will all be uppercase
            -MAX_LENGTH
